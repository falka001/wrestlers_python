# wrestlers_python

This project is similar to the C++ Wrestlers project, but has some differences. The ability scores of the two teams of wrestlers is generated by getting a random variable, then dividing the weight by that random variable. The winner is decided by summing up all the ability scores of the wrestlers per group, and comparing the sum of both teams. For example, if 11 wrestlers from Team A in the weight class A have a summed score of 30, and 14 wrestlers from Team B in the same weight class have a summed score of 20; then the 11 wrestlers from Team A wins.

This project isn't detailed according to wrestling rules, it is created for gaining experience in the use of data structures and python packages.
